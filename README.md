# monero-gui-freebsd

I don't know if this port will be added to the official repo since it depends on Qt5 which will be deprecated soon, but you at least can install it from this repo. The task in bugzilla can be found [here](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=281103).

If this port won't be added to the ports, you can wait until I migrate Monero GUI to Qt6.
